Project architecture: **Monorepo (Turborepo + Bun) + Modular Monolith**. Scope constraints: 4 developers, 10 weeks. No Microservices, no Event Sourcing.

## 2. On-Demand Documentation (`docs/`)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To preserve context, AI agents should **ONLY** read the following documents when the task specifically requires detailed context on that domain:
>
> - [`docs/db-diagram.md`](file:///home/owen/Projects/storeX/docs/db-diagram.md): Canonical source of truth for database schema design, entities, relationships, and constraints. Read it for any database schema or migration task.
> - [`docs/backend-patterns.md`](file:///home/owen/Projects/storeX/docs/backend-patterns.md): Route → Service → Repository, State Machines, Strategy/Adapter patterns, Transactions & Idempotency.
> - [`docs/web-patterns.md`](file:///home/owen/Projects/storeX/docs/web-patterns.md): Next.js App Router, Feature-based structure, Server/Client/Form state separation, TanStack Query, Zustand.
> - [`docs/mobile-patterns.md`](file:///home/owen/Projects/storeX/docs/mobile-patterns.md): React Native + Expo structure, Screen → Hook → API Client flow.
> - [`docs/engineering-principles.md`](file:///home/owen/Projects/storeX/docs/engineering-principles.md): The 20 mandatory engineering principles for storeX.

## 3. Core Engineering Rules for Agents

1. **Follow the Architecture**: Do not introduce new architectural patterns, layers, or microservices.
2. **Feature-based Slices**: Organize code by feature/domain. Never put business logic in routes, screens, or UI components.
3. **Strict State Separation**: Server state (TanStack Query), Client state (Zustand when necessary), Form state (React Hook Form + Zod).
4. **Data Integrity**: Database is the source of truth. Use database transactions and row-level locks for concurrent/consistent flows. Never expose DB models directly to frontend.
5. **Database Diagram & Schema-First Migrations**: Treat [`docs/db-diagram.md`](file:///home/owen/Projects/storeX/docs/db-diagram.md) as the source of truth for the intended database model. Before designing or changing database schema, read and follow the diagram. For every database change, update the diagram and the Drizzle schema in `packages/database` together so they stay in sync; generate migrations with `bun run db:generate`. Never edit generated migration files directly (`packages/database/drizzle/*`). If the diagram is missing details needed for a change, clarify and update the diagram before implementing the schema.
6. **Business Clarity & Confidence Threshold (< 95%)**: Always verify domain requirements with the user before implementing features. If confidence in implementing according to exact business rules is below 95%, proactively ask clarifying questions instead of making assumptions. Never speculate; mark unknowns as `TBD`.
7. **Related-Issue Consistency**: Before implementation, review related, dependent, and potentially conflicting issues and existing domain decisions. Keep shared schemas, APIs, workflows, and data models compatible across those issues; do not optimize a single issue in isolation.
8. **Propose Further Decisions Before Implementation**: Always provide design choices, trade-offs, alternatives, and further decisions for the user to review and align on before beginning implementation.
9. **TDD & Business-Driven Testing (No Fabricated Tests)**: Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD). Before creating tests, thoroughly question and clarify all business requirements with the user. Only proceed to write tests when confidence in understanding the business domain reaches at least 95%. Never invent, speculate, or fabricate test cases based on assumptions. Always present the planned test cases and explain what each test is for to the user before implementation.
10. **No Overengineering**: Shared abstractions only when reused in ≥2 places. Keep code readable and easily handoff-ready.

## 4. Build, Lint, and Development Commands

Run all commands from repository root with Bun:

```bash
bun install                         # Install workspace dependencies
bun run dev                         # Run all workspaces in dev mode
bun run --filter web dev             # Run only Web (port 3000)
bun run --filter api dev             # Run only API (port 4000)
bun run --filter mobile dev         # Run only Mobile (Expo dev server)
bun run db:generate                 # Generate Drizzle SQL migrations
bun run db:migrate                  # Run Drizzle SQL migrations
bun run test                        # Run unit and integration tests across workspaces
bun run build                        # Build all workspaces with Turborepo
bun run check-types                  # Type-check all packages
bun run check                        # Run Biome lint & format checks
bun run check:fix                    # Apply Biome auto-fixes
```

## 5. Coding Style & Conventions

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode across all packages.
- **Formatting & Linting**: Biome is the source of truth (2 spaces, double quotes, semicolons, 100 max line length). Run `bun run check:fix` before committing.
- **Naming**: PascalCase for components/types, camelCase for functions/variables, kebab-case for route and config filenames.
- **Contracts**: Always use shared types/schemas (`packages/contracts` or `@storex/shared`).

## 6. Commit & Git Hook Guidelines

- **Husky Pre-commit**: Automatically runs `biome check --staged` on staged files.
- **Conventional Commits**: Format `<type>: <imperative summary>` (e.g., `feat: add booking state machine`, `fix: resolve payment webhook race condition`).

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **storeX** (1580 symbols, 3331 relationships, 122 execution flows).

> Index stale? Run `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze --index-only` from the project root — it auto-selects an available runner. No `.gitnexus/run.cjs` yet? Bootstrap with `npx`, `bunx`, or `pnpm dlx` — e.g. `bunx gitnexus@latest analyze` (npm 11 npx crash; #1939).

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact before editing.** Use `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` or `node .gitnexus/run.cjs impact "symbolName" --direction upstream --repo .`; report callers, processes, and risk. Never substitute grep for graph analysis.
- **MUST analyze graph changes before committing.** Use `detect_changes({scope: "all"})` (MCP) or `node .gitnexus/run.cjs detect-changes --scope all --repo .` (CLI fallback). `partial: true` or `truncated: true` is not a clean check — a zero means unseen, not unaffected; re-run it. For regression review: `detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})` or `node .gitnexus/run.cjs detect-changes --scope compare --base-ref "main" --repo .`.
- MUST warn on HIGH/CRITICAL `risk` pre-edit; never use `riskSharedAxes` to waive a HIGH/CRITICAL `risk` warning. Compare File/symbol: MCP File omits axes; Graph-RAG expands File.
- **MUST treat `risk: UNKNOWN` as unresolved, not as low.** An empty caller set is not evidence the symbol is unused — it can also mean the callers are not resolvable by the index (plain-object property access, dynamic dispatch, cross-language calls). `impact` pairs `UNKNOWN` with a `riskNote` saying so. Confirm with a text search before treating the symbol as safe to change or delete; do not proceed on the strength of a zero.
- **MUST use `query({search_query: "concept"})` for concepts/flows, `context({name: "symbolName"})` for a named symbol, or `impact` for blast radius, on read-only callers, dependencies, imports, or execution flow.** Graph first; text search only for empty/`UNKNOWN`/literals.
- For security review, `explain({target: "fileOrSymbol"})` lists taint findings (source→sink flows; needs `analyze --pdg`).

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method before MCP/CLI impact analysis.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis, and never read `UNKNOWN` as an all-clear — it means the walk could not answer, which is the one verdict that requires confirming by other means.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit before MCP/CLI graph change analysis.
